This step is about analyzing the dataset & using your machine learning skills to solve real world problems.

Please find the dataset with this file. The task is to wrangle the data, solve the problem and present your results in a deck.


To give context the data represents a total of 1747 images of coffee entire leaves, including healthy leaves and diseased leaves, affected by
one or more types of biotic stresses.

The dataset contains the following stresses:
  leaf miner,
  rust,
  brown leaf spot and 
  cercospora leaf spot. 

The images were labeled in relation to the predominant biotic stress of each leaf and its severity.

Severity is mapped in the csv file as follows:
	1- Healthy : 0
 	2- Very low : 1
 	3- Low : 2
 	4- High : 3
 	5- Very high : 4


Your task is to train a model that is capable of identifying:
	1- The stresses present
	2- The severity of the predominant stress
	
We are expecting you to submit the following:
	1- Your Notebook Code
	2- csv file involves image name, stresses present and the severity


We do not judge the accuracy only, Try your best to extract meaningful insights and key findings, do the required analysis and select the appropriate approach.

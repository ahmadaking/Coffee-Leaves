Notes :
1- The project is written in the form of Python files (python.py) and for ease of operation from the terminal, a jupyter note file is attached to run train and testing.
2- At the beginning of my work on the project, I wrote a complete code from scratching, but during my research I found some helpful resources and built on them, which are the ones in your hands and I did not attach my files to avoid confusion.
3- The results that I sent to you are not final due to my limited resources (free time limited online machines) and definitely if I had more resources, it would have been complete and better than that.
4- I tried many models and did tuning to reach the best result, also with what I had from the resources.
5- Attached files are as follows:
	- csv file involves image name, stresses present and the severity , for two models (my free limited time online machines fineshed)
	- jupyter-note-book to run train and testing and contain some analysis on the data.
	- internet link contain the full code files :
